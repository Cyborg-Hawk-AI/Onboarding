# Git + Playground Workflow — Team Onboarding

**This document is the presentation.** No other slides or media. Use it as your deck and script.

**Duration:** ~20–25 min

---

# Slide 1 — Welcome

## We're standardizing how we work in the dev repo

By the end of this you will know:

- **Where** we work (one repo, one branch)
- **How** we push without overwriting each other
- **What** to run when you want to push or when you get errors

---

# Slide 2 — The big picture

## Two repos, two roles

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  subgraph Playground["🟢 PLAYGROUND"]
    A[actionit-dev]
  end
  subgraph Production["🔴 PRODUCTION"]
    B[axnt-dev-workspace]
  end
  Team[("👥 All engineers")]
  CTO[("👤 CTO / designated")]
  Team -->|"push daily"| A
  A -->|"promote when validated"| B
  CTO -->|"push after validation"| B
```

| Repo | Role | Who pushes |
|------|------|------------|
| **actionit-dev** | 🟢 Playground | All of us |
| **axnt-dev-workspace** | 🔴 Production | CTO after validation |

**You only work in actionit-dev.** Production is updated only when we promote validated code.

---

# Slide 3 — Where you work (playground)

## One repo, one branch, one remote

```mermaid
flowchart TB
  subgraph Your Machine
    Local["Your clone\n(actionit-dev)"]
    Branch["Branch: dev-workspace"]
  end
  subgraph GitHub
    Remote["origin → actionit-dev"]
  end
  Local --> Branch
  Branch -->|"push / pull"| Remote
```

| What | Value |
|------|--------|
| **Repo** | actionit-dev (playground) |
| **Remote** | `origin` |
| **Branch** | `dev-workspace` |

**Daily work:** Clone actionit-dev, work on `dev-workspace`, push to **origin dev-workspace**. We do **not** push to axnt-dev-workspace from normal dev work.

---

# Slide 4 — Why we don't overwrite each other

## Git merges commits; it doesn't overwrite file-by-file

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant Dev1
  participant Remote as origin (actionit-dev)
  participant Dev2
  Dev1->>Remote: push (FileA, FileB)
  Dev2->>Remote: push (FileC, FileD) ❌ rejected
  Remote-->>Dev2: "Updates were rejected"
  Dev2->>Remote: pull (gets Dev1's commit)
  Note over Dev2: Merge: Dev1's A,B + Dev2's C,D
  Dev2->>Remote: push ✅
  Note over Remote: Everyone's changes combined
```

- **Pull before you push** → you get others' latest commits.
- **Push rejected?** → Pull, then push again.
- **Different files** → Git combines both automatically.
- **Same file, same lines** → Git asks you to resolve a conflict once.

---

# Slide 5 — The one rule

## Pull before push

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  A[Start work] --> B[Pull]
  B --> C[Code]
  C --> D[Commit]
  D --> E[Push]
  E --> F{Done?}
  F -->|Rejected| B
  F -->|OK| G[✅]
```

**If your push is rejected:** run the pull script (or `git pull origin dev-workspace`), fix any conflicts if Git says so, then push again.

---

# Slide 6 — Daily workflow

## Before work → Code → Push

```mermaid
flowchart TB
  Start([Start of day]) --> Pull["Run: ./scripts/pull-latest.sh"]
  Pull --> Work[Code in your editor]
  Work --> Push["Run: ./scripts/push-to-playground.sh"]
  Push --> Done([Your changes are on the playground])
```

1. **Before work:** `./scripts/pull-latest.sh` (or `git pull origin dev-workspace`).
2. **Work** in your editor.
3. **When you want to push:** `./scripts/push-to-playground.sh`.

---

# Slide 7 — The scripts (no guessing)

## Two scripts, same repo root

| Script | When to use | What it does |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| **push-to-playground.sh** | When you want to push your changes | Switches to dev-workspace if needed, pulls, shows status, optionally commits, pushes to **origin dev-workspace** |
| **pull-latest.sh** | Before work or when you get errors (e.g. rejected push) | Pulls latest from **origin dev-workspace** so you have the team's changes |

Both assume you're already authenticated (e.g. `gh auth login`) and using the actionit-dev repo. They only talk to **origin** (actionit-dev); they never push to production.

---

# Slide 8 — What the push script does (step by step)

```mermaid
flowchart TB
  A[Run ./scripts/push-to-playground.sh] --> B[On dev-workspace?]
  B -->|No| C[Switch to dev-workspace]
  B -->|Yes| D[Pull from origin]
  C --> D
  D --> E[Show git status]
  E --> F[Uncommitted changes?]
  F -->|Yes| G[Ask: add & commit?]
  G --> H[Push to origin dev-workspace]
  F -->|No| H
  H --> I[✅ Done]
```

- **Safe:** No force-push, no pushing to production. Only **origin dev-workspace** (actionit-dev).

---

# Slide 9 — When you get errors

## Use the pull script first

| Error or situation | What to do |
|--------------------|------------|
| **"Updates were rejected"** | Run `./scripts/pull-latest.sh`, then run `./scripts/push-to-playground.sh` again. |
| **"Merge conflict"** | Open the file(s) Git names, fix the conflict markers (keep or edit both sides), save, `git add <file>`, then run the push script again. |
| **Permission / auth** | Confirm you're a collaborator on actionit-dev and run `gh auth login` (or use your HTTPS token). |

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  Error[❌ Error] --> Pull[Run pull-latest.sh]
  Pull --> Fix[Fix conflicts if any]
  Fix --> Push[Run push-to-playground.sh]
  Push --> OK[✅]
```

---

# Slide 10 — First-time setup

## Clone, branch, auth

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Cyborg-Hawk-AI/actionit-dev.git
cd actionit-dev
git checkout dev-workspace
gh auth login
```

- **Repo link:** https://github.com/Cyborg-Hawk-AI/actionit-dev  
- **Scripts:** `scripts/push-to-playground.sh` and `scripts/pull-latest.sh` (run from repo root).  
- **Quick reference:** `docs/GIT_QUICK_REFERENCE.md`  
- **Full strategy:** `docs/GIT_AND_CICD_STRATEGY.md`

# Slide 11 — Recap

## One place, one branch, one rule, two scripts

| | |
|--|--|
| **Playground** | actionit-dev (remote **origin**) |
| **Branch** | dev-workspace |
| **Rule** | Pull before push |
| **Push** | `./scripts/push-to-playground.sh` |
| **Pull / errors** | `./scripts/pull-latest.sh` |

We work only in **actionit-dev** on **dev-workspace**; we push only to **origin**. Production (axnt-dev-workspace) is updated only when the CTO promotes validated code.

---

# Slide 12 — Q&A and wrap

**Common questions:**

- **"Updates were rejected?"** → Run `./scripts/pull-latest.sh`, then push again.
- **"Merge conflict?"** → Open the file, fix the markers, save, `git add` that file, run the push script again.
- **"Can I push without the script?"** → Yes: `git pull origin dev-workspace`, then `git add` / `git commit` / `git push origin dev-workspace`.

**Wrap:** All details and the "why" are in `docs/GIT_AND_CICD_STRATEGY.md` and `docs/GIT_QUICK_REFERENCE.md`. This doc is your presentation; no other supplemental media.

## Presenter checklist

- [ ] Add everyone as collaborators to **actionit-dev** (playground).
- [ ] Share repo: https://github.com/Cyborg-Hawk-AI/actionit-dev
- [ ] Point to scripts: `scripts/push-to-playground.sh`, `scripts/pull-latest.sh`
- [ ] Point to quick reference: `docs/GIT_QUICK_REFERENCE.md`
- [ ] Demo: run pull script, then push script, and walk through the output.
